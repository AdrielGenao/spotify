My first introduction into API's and the subject of HTTP requests. I have created a test account, but the program can work with any Spotify Account: Username: adrielgenao@yahoo.com  Password: TestAccount1 . The program takes the first five top-listened-to songs of a user and recommends 5 songs for each based on Spotify's algorithm for recommendations.
